# A LibGDX game demonstrating using [KTX](https://github.com/libktx/ktx) with fixed time steps

This is a demo of the stutering issue found when using fixed time steps in KtxGame.

To switch between fixed time steps and dynamic ones, set the ```useFixedStep``` parameter when
creating KtxGame.

For more information see [KTX issue 95](https://github.com/libktx/ktx/issues/95).
